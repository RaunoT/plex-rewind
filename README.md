# Plex Rewind

A Plex Rewind application in the spirit of [Spotify Wrapped](https://www.spotify.com/us/wrapped).

Present user statistics and habits in a beautiful and organized manner - as a web application application powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com), using data from [Tautulli](https://tautulli.com) and [Overseerr](https://overseerr.dev/). You can also disable the Rewind functionality and just use it as a sharable Dashboard for your Plex users or vice versa.
