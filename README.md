A Plex Rewind application inspired by the likes of [Spotify Wrapped](https://www.spotify.com/us/wrapped) and [Tautulli](https://tautulli.com).

Present [Plex](https://plex.tv) user statistics and habits in a beautiful and organized manner - as a web application application powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com), using data from [Tautulli](https://tautulli.com), [Overseerr](https://overseerr.dev) and [Plex](https://plex.tv). You can also disable the Rewind functionality and just use it as an easily sharable Dashboard for your Plex users or vice versa!

- üîê Log in with Plex - uses [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org) to enable secure login and session management with your Plex account.
- üöÄ PWA support - installable on mobile devices and desktops thanks to [Serwist](https://github.com/serwist/serwist).

## Getting started

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` in your location of choice and run `docker compose up -d`. The app will be available at `http://localhost:8383`.

```yml
services:
  plex-rewind:
    image: ghcr.io/raunot/plex-rewind:latest # :develop for the latest development version
    container_name: plex-rewind
    environment:
      - NEXTAUTH_SECRET= # (required) used to encrypt auth JWT token, generate one with `openssl rand -base64 32`
      - NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:8383 # (required) change to your domain if you are exposing the app to the internet
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:8383 # (required) change to your domain if you are exposing the app to the internet
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
    ports:
      - 8383:8383
    restart: unless-stopped
```

> _NOTE: If you run into authentication issues, try setting `NEXTAUTH_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to your external Docker IP, instead of localhost. For example `http://192.168.1.1:8383`._

For those that need it, a simple status page is also available at `/api/status`.
